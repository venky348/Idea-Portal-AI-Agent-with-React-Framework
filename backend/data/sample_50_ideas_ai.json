The new features will include:\n\n1. Role-based access control: Users will be able to define their roles and permissions, and only those with the required permissions will be able to access the system.\n\n2. Multi-factor authentication: This will ensure that only authorized users will be able to access the system.\n\n3. Password policies: We will create a password policy that will ensure that users' passwords are strong and not easily guessable.\n\n4. Audit trails: We will implement audit trails to monitor user activities and identify any suspicious activities.\n\n5. Access controls for sensitive data: We will implement access controls for sensitive data, such as financial data, to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n6. User training: We will provide user training on the new features to ensure that users understand how to use them effectively.\n\n7. Implementation timeline: We will implement the new features in phases, starting with the role-based access control, followed by multi-factor authentication, password policies, audit trails, access controls for sensitive data, and user training.\n\n8.
